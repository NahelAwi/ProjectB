-ask koby about hand X camera attachement patent
-generic camera + ai model activation file 


Main:
-understand this Model : deeplabv3_resnet101
    Architecture, possible optimizations: more classes, faster ...
-find better model for segmentation ?
-use segmentation + PCA for tilt prediction


Secondary:
-find a working YOLO (using depthai-viewer for example) - (.blob)
-ai model for finding key points on objects detected by our YOLO 
-ai for calculating orientationg based on the points above
-check depthai-viewer for correct use of YOLO
