Main Plan:
-understand this Model : deeplabv3_resnet101
    Architecture, possible optimizations: more classes, faster ...

-use segmentation + PCA for tilt prediction

-find better model for segmentation.
    try these models from OpenVINO's Model Zoo (by order):
        deeplabv3_mobilenetv2
        instance-segmentation-security-0002
        fastseg-small
        UNet-Mobilenet-V2


Later (optimizations):
-if no good model in OpenVINO's Model Zoo, try other pre-trained models and convert them to ".blob"
-if no good pre-trained models, fine tune one.
    














2nd plan (valid only if camera is placed on top of the rotating part of the hand):
-object alignment detection


other less relevant direction:
-find a working YOLO (using depthai-viewer for example) - (.blob)
-ai model for finding key points on objects detected by our YOLO 
-ai for calculating orientationg based on the points above
-check depthai-viewer for correct use of YOLO
